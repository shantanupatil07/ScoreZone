Welcome to Football Tournament Manager

For whom is this website for?

-> This website allows different football Managers to enroll their teams to play in a football tournament.(7 players with 4/3 substitute players)
-> Max tournament pool size is 20 teams.Once the pool is filled managers cannot add teams.

What does this website offer?

-> This site is for multiple users i.e (Online users , Team Managers , Tournament Manager)

-> Online users: Will be able to enjoy the Live scores, team exploration, upcoming matches, past results i.e (Read only access). (Without login)

->Managers: New Managers have to sign up for the first time to enroll their teams. Max 20 Managers with their teams are allowed. 
They have all the access that the Online users have, with that each manager needs to manage his team before every match. Hence, each manager when logged in will be directed to his team page, where he will get a detailed view of matches, points table, available players, and final team submission for to be played matches.

->Tournament Manager(TM) : TM will have his separate credentials where he generates matches, decides groups, updates the score, submissions from Team managers are accepted by TM . Basically running the whole tournament is the work of TM.

How are we making this?

->There is a lot of frontend (i.e) from a visual point of view. (major use of ReactJS)
->Backend (SpringBoot with REST & .NET)
->Database (MySQL) . If needed Mongodb.

As the database complexity is very less we will be focusing on implementing different features.
Like Tournament generation, team winning probablity, dynamic points table, display of top scoring players , etc.
